# Bring your web animations to the next level

## Slides

In this repo you will find two files with the slides from my presentation on 4 July in Nuremberg. One file is a Keynote source file for MacOS. The second is a PDF with static images instead of animated videos. Use this PDF as a fallback and for fast content scan.

## Demo

You can start the demo project with ```npm run dev```command. All the interesting content you will find in ```index.html```,```detail.html``` and CSS files from public folder.
